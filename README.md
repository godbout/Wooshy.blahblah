If you're willing to let him take a rest from time to time then you're all set.
Else you may consider treating Wooshy [one coffee a month](https://subscribe.wooshy.app).
Yes software have feelings but hey Wooshy time to grow up!

# The Roadmap

* stop stealing focus so that all those new macOS popovers don't disappear (requires a big rewrite)
* Text Selection Popover feature so that you can forward text found by Wooshy to other apps (https://github.com/godbout/Wooshy.docs/issues/151)

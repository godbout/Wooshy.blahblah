# The Site

[wooshy.app](https://wooshy.app) for the handsome marketing thing. Looks like it's using Comic Sans MS but it's not, I swear.

# Manual

## Search

Wooshy will search through UI elements' metadata, i.e. labels, titles, values, tooltips, types etc.

Wooshy's philosophy is to avoid navigation.
Rather, you do a gross search, and if needed you narrow down to (hopefully) the specific target you want.
That sounds slower but it's actually way more natural. The way it works is:

1. you type part of what you're looking for
2. if you have multiple results, you narrow down the results with a... _narrower_

E.g. you want something with `bacon`:

| search term     | narrower | matches                                                   | whole typing                                   
| :---:            | :---:    |  :---:                                                     | :---:
| `bacon`           |          | anything that contains "bacon" (will not match pig sorry) | `bacon`
| `bacon`           | `^`        | anything that starts with "bacon"                         | `bacon ^` 
| `bacon`           | `$`        | anything that ends with "bacon"                           | `bacon $`
| `bacon`           | `!`        | anything that is exactly "bacon"                          | `bacon !`
| `the bacon`       | `tab`      | anything that contains "the bacon" and is a tab :))       | `the bacon tab`

The search term can also be:
1. a star (`*`) that will show all the UI elements that you can target
2. a type of UI element. Don't think too much, just type. e.g. tab, radio, checkbox, button, pop up, toggle. (You never need to type the whole... type, just part of it is enough most of the time.)

## Navigate

If you still need or want to navigate through the results, you can with:

| target         | key | 
| :---:           | :---:
| next           | `tab` or `down` or `control n`
| previous        | `shift tab` or `up` or `control p`
| first           | `command up`
| last           | `command down`
| halfway up       | `control up`
| halfway down       | `control down`

If you use [kindaVim](https://github.com/godbout/kindaVim.docs), add Wooshy to the `Key Mapping` Family. Then you'll be able to navigate with Vim moves by entering Normal Mode and:

| target         | kindaVim move | 
| :---:           | :---: 
| next           | `j` or `down` or `control j` or `control n`
| previous        | `k` or `up` or `control p`
| first           | `gg`
| last           | `G`
| halfway up       | `control b` or `control u` 
| halfway down       | `control f` or `control d`

## Click

What would be Wooshy without all the clicks. Currently you can click the Primary Target with:

| keyboard               | mouse equivalent | 
| :---:                  | :---: 
| `return`               | left click
| `control return`       | right click
| `option return`        | option click
| `shift return`         | shift click
| `command return`       | command click

# Roadmap

## alpha/beta

- [x] video explaining the Search and Target Navigation
- [ ] show possible matching terms for any potential Target while hovering over them when The Input is showing.
This is necessary for Targets that don't have text like icons, images, etc.
- [x] multi monitors support
- [x] find a way to make the Targets stand out on light backgrounds
- [ ] improve clicking. some places don't register the click (e.g. App Store, own account at bottom left)
- [x] **this has been done as an [Alfred Workflow](https://github.com/godbout/WooshyWindowToTheForeground)**.~~(30%) find a way to bring any visible window to the foreground and become the frontmost window.~~
- [ ] handle double clicks. at first i thought it was not necessary as you can open anything with `âŒ˜o` but some places, at least in the new macOS Ventura, require double clicks (shit iOS-style bs)
- [ ] be able to target Notifications

## v1+

- [ ] add a mode without The Input showing, so that focus is not stolen from macOS.
this will allow using Wooshy for menu contents, popovers, notifications, etc.
but will require the user to type more properly (can still show what is typed a la kV Characters Window, and allow for delete of last character, etc.).
- [ ] allow customization of Targets visual properties

## maybe

- [ ] (70%) fuzzy search. maybe not wholly fuzzy, but also not just the first letter of words. more like you can type the beginning of a word, a space, and the beginning of another word
- [ ] (10%) grab not only Targets from the frontmost window, but all visible windows.
(although that may pollute the results and ultimately be harder to reach what one wants.)
- [ ] (2%) OCR support.
through the Accessibility we grab whole objects, but not specific words in text.
sometimes we may want to target a specific word, or to access objects that are not accessible (e.g. the individual sections in Alfre's Preferences sidebar).

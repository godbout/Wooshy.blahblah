# Known Issues

* Wooshy may hang sometimes if you're using it to open its own Preferences while the selected tab is Location.
no idea why yet.

# Roadmap

## alpha/beta

- [ ] video explaining the Search and Target Navigation
- [ ] show possible matching terms for any potential Target while hovering over them when The Input is showing.
this is necessary for Targets that don't have text like icons, images, etc.
- [ ] multi monitors support
- [ ] find a way to make the Targets stand out on light backgrounds
- [ ] improve clicking. some places don't register the click (e.g. App Store, own account at bottom left)

## v1+

- [ ] add a mode without The Input showing, so that focus is not stolen from macOS.
this will allow using Wooshy for menu contents, popovers, notifications, etc.
but will require the user to type more properly (can still show what is typed a la kV Characters Window, and allow for delete of last character, etc.).
- [ ] allow customization of Targets visual properties

## maybe

- [ ] (30%) find a way to bring any visible window to the foreground and become the frontmost window.
Alfred only works for apps, not windows, and sometimes you can't even grab the main window if it's background app.
- [ ] (10%) grab not only Targets from the frontmost window, but all visible windows.
(although that may polute the results and ultimately be harder to reach what one wants.)
